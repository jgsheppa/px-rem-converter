# Px/Rem

## Usecase

The company I work for uses rem as the standard measurement for our CSS files. Px still seems to creep in from time to time, and these px values need to be converted to rem. There are websites to accomplish this task, but I find myself googling for converter sites every time I need to make a conversion.

## Styling

I took inspiration from the Github color schemes, particularly their colorblind light and dark modes.
